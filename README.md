# UFOs: The Truth is Out There!
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Dana has been vigilant in her work and earned the right to work on a topic she is passionate about.  Growing up in McMinnville, Oregon there was a high prevalence of UFO sightings, and this subject has interested her since she was a child hearing the tail of Farmer Trent’s Farm.  Dana wishes to spread the enjoyment of UFO sightings to others in a user-friendly HTML website.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria.

The website we have created is very appealing and easy to use for the casual UFO browser. When the website is first visited, the article Dana wrote is presented, followed by a table of UFO sightings and a group of filters that the user could narrow their search with. Currently, there are placeholders in the search boxes to prompt the user to search each category. As the user enters the value into the search box and presses enter, the categories will update accordingly.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

Given the current coding, there are a few improvements that could be made to really ensure the users are receiving the service that Dana wishes to provide.

-	One major issue in the search engine is that it is case sensitive.  The majority of the reported UFO sightings are found within the US; however, if the user types in US, there will be no findings in the table as seen below. This issue pertains to all search categories.

-	Another suggestion would be to alter the search engine. Pertaining to the date search, a range of dates might be more inclusive of what a UFO enthusiast is searching for. Instead of searching each date, they would be able to see possible sightings for a given timeframe, saving them time and the ability to view multiple days. 

-	Dropdown menus may be beneficial for the category of shape due to the many categories that wouldn’t be technically considered shapes (light, formation, fireball, other, ect.).

-	 As we find with most provided data, there are human errors.  The presented data in the tables is very sloppy and inconsistent. I would suggest to create coding that would minimize the number of errors and possibly create a more uniform duration. The less faults presented on the website, the more professional it would appear.

-	An additional search engine could be a dropdown menu of bins with the duration of UFO sightings. A user may be interested in trends regarding to duration.

Overall, the subject of UFO’s is intriguing and will captivate the minds of many for years to come. The website we created for Dana is a great creation for those seeking knowledge of extraterrestrials.  Hopefully others with the passion Dana has towards McMinnville and UFOs are inspired to continue their own search for truth through this website.
